1. Lack of trust.

For Lencioni, trust is the foundation of a successful team. If people worry about making mistakes, they don't put forward new ideas, and the group suffers. To help your team open up, try asking for help. By being honest about your limitations, you'll show them it's okay to be vulnerable. Better yet, the group will see they can achieve more by supporting each other.
